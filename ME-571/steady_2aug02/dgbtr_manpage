*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGBTRF computes an LU factorization of a real m-by-n band matrix A
*  using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
*
*  This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KL      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
*
*  KU      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows KL+1 to
*          2*KL+KU+1; rows 1 to KL of the array need not be set.
*          The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
*          array AB as follows:
*          AB(kl+ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(m,j+kl)
*
*          On exit, details of the factorization: U is stored as an
*          upper triangular band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in
*          rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and the multipliers used during the
*          factorization are stored in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
*          See below for further details.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= min(M,N), row i of the
*          matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = +i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
*               has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*               singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
*               to solve a system of equations.
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The band storage scheme is illustrated by the following example, when
*  M = N = 6, KL = 2, KU = 1:
*
*  On entry:                       On exit:
*
*      *    *    *    +    +    +       *    *    *   u14  u25  u36
*      *    *    +    +    +    +       *    *   u13  u24  u35  u46
*      *   a12  a23  a34  a45  a56      *   u12  u23  u34  u45  u56
*     a11  a22  a33  a44  a55  a66     u11  u22  u33  u44  u55  u66
*     a21  a32  a43  a54  a65   *      m21  m32  m43  m54  m65   *
*     a31  a42  a53  a64   *    *      m31  m42  m53  m64   *    *
*
*  Array elements marked * are not used by the routine; elements marked
*  + need not be set on entry, but are required by the routine to store
*  elements of U because of fill-in resulting from the row interchanges.
